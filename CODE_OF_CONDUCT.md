# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate of differing viewpoints.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being supportive and empathetic towards others.
- Focusing on collaboration and constructive feedback.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, trolling, or derogatory comments.
- Intimidation or threats.
- Discrimination or exclusionary behavior.
- Unwanted advances or inappropriate content.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution
